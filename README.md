## Soda Water Software Ray Tracer

This is the ray tracer that I built in my 3d graphics class for
graduate school.  The project was written in C++ and used Qt for
the drawing library (which, in retospect, was probably overkill).

I have not attempted to rebuild this project as I don't really
want to reinstall the Qt libraries and I don't think I would
get much from building it.  Instead I'm attempting to rebuild
a ray tracer in Go in the Ray The Tracer repo.

Even though I did not rebuild the project I did find a collection
of images I created from this project which are in the [images](images)
directory.  The rest of this document is mostly untouched from when
I initially worked on this

--------

Written for QT 2.3.1 ... but should be upwards compatible to 3.0.
